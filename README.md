Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a transformative tool for the design of mechanical metamaterials, offering properties that far surpass those achievable through lab-based
trial-and-error methods. However, a major challenge in current inverse design strategies is
their reliance on extensive computational and/or experimental datasets, which becomes
particularly problematic for designing micro-scale stochastic architected materials that
exhibit nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Here, we introduce a comprehensive end-to-end
scientific ML framework, leveraging deep neural operators (including DeepONet and its
variants), to directly learn the relationship between the complete microstructure and
mechanical response of architected metamaterials from sparse but high-quality in situ
experimental data. We systematically compare various neural operators and standard
neural networks to identify the model that offers better interpretability and accuracy.
The approach facilitates the inverse design of structures tailored to specific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from stochastic spinodal microstructures, printed
using two-photon lithography, reveal that the prediction error for mechanical responses
is within a range of 5 - 10%. Our work underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced nano- and micro-mechanics experimental techniques, the design of
complex micro-architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in
scenarios constrained by data scarcity. Our work marks a significant advancement in
the field of materials-by-design, potentially heralding a new era in the discovery and de-
velopment of next-generation metamaterials with unparalleled mechanical characteristics
derived directly from experimental insights.
