The stress-strain curves in Figure 5 of the main paper can be plotted by running the inverse design directly. 

The inverse design is in the following locations: Inverse>Two_step_deeponet_qr>Portion4>code_diffseed>main_add_experiment1_final.py

When running main_add_experiment1_final.py, you need the pool, which can be download from the dropbox.
